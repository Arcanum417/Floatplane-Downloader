This covers what each setting is and what you can change it to. 

Note that "max" type settings apply separately to each channel, so maxVideos set to 4 means 4 videos for Floatplane and BitWit Ultra, if you have both enabled.

As of v3.8.2 the script now can generate the section id from the url for the section as can be seen below: [![https://gyazo.com/df26f5bbb22fc5c70f2b8714a30ce54c](https://i.gyazo.com/df26f5bbb22fc5c70f2b8714a30ce54c.gif)](https://gyazo.com/df26f5bbb22fc5c70f2b8714a30ce54c)

The section is is the last number in the url.

You can also just enter the ID into the prompt the script gives, this prompt will only display if the section id is set to 0 which is the default.
