**There is now a auto installer! You can download and run it here: [Install.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-Downloader/master/releases/Install.zip)**

To install using the **[Install.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-Downloader/master/releases/Install.zip)**, make sure you have Node.js installed, download the **[Install.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-Downloader/master/releases/Install.zip)** unzip it into the folder you want the script in and run install.bat. **Then skip to part 3 of this guide**.

To install manually continue to read below.

**You can download the latest stable version from here: https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-PlexDownloader/releases**

1. **Download the script:**

   >Make sure to extract the files on the drive you want the videos saved to. Or you can syslink the videos folder to the drive you want. You can now also change the video folder directory in the settings.json file, make sure to copy the folders inside the videos folder over though!
   
**When getting the latest release [Stable] do this:**

3. **Install [ffmpeg](ffmpeg.org) (If not running Windows):**

   >In order to set the title's of videos for Plex you need ffmpeg installed.

4. **Login:**
   >**To use the script you need to login, you can do this two ways.**

   >
   >Note this stores your username and password in plaintext in settings.json. However you can manually delete them from settings.json, and the script will only ask you to log back in if your session stored in the settings expires.
   >
   >**Or manually set them yourself which is noted below.**  
   >**If you dont login with a username/email & password or use 2Factor you may need to do this.**
5. **Manually set your cookies [OPTIONAL]:**

   >You need to login to the LTT forums preferably with keep me logged in checked and then inspect a Floatplane forum post page.

If you want to change any other settings, you can do so now inside the settings.json file. More info on settings can be found here: **[Settings Guide](https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-PlexDownloader/blob/master/wiki/settings.md)**

6. **Plex Update:**

   **Note:** This requires plex to have been set-up already which is covered in the **[Plex Guide](https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-PlexDownloader/blob/master/wiki/plex.md)**

   If you want plex to update after downloading new videos (fixing the issue with some video titles not updating after being downloaded until you refresh metadata) set the localPlex setting to true if plex is installed on the same system the script is on, or set remotePlex to true if its installed on another PC.
   
   You can either fill out the other plex settings stated in the settings.json yourself now or run the script which will prompt you for what is needed.
   
   To get the plex section for Floatplane you can just do this:
   [![https://gyazo.com/df26f5bbb22fc5c70f2b8714a30ce54c](https://i.gyazo.com/df26f5bbb22fc5c70f2b8714a30ce54c.gif)](https://gyazo.com/df26f5bbb22fc5c70f2b8714a30ce54c)
   
   Note that the script gets the ID from that url, just pasting the url into the settings.json will not work.
   
   For remote plex the script will prompt you to enter your plex username and password, these are not saved but just used to generate a token the script can use to remotely trigger a section update. This token is saved into settings.json. The script will also prompt you for the remote servers IP and PORT if you have not entered those. The IP is the ip of the plex server you are trying to connect to and the port only needs to be entered if you are not using the default.
   
   For localPlex you also need to ensure that plexScannerInstall is correct, this should be correct by default unless you are not running Windows or have not installed plex to the default location.
   
   There is more information about the plex settings in the **[Settings Guide](https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-PlexDownloader/blob/master/wiki/settings.md)**.

7. **Profit?:**

   At this point you should be completely set-up and ready to go!  
   To start the script all you need to do is run the **Floatplane.bat** file.  
   If you want to start the script from console yourself, just use "**node float.js**"  

The script will download the videos into the videos folder along with their thumbnails. If you want to set-up Plex, read the guide here: **[Plex Guide](https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-PlexDownloader/blob/master/wiki/plex.md)**
